## Preprocessor

1. Using the **#define statement**, how would you declare a manifest constant that returns the number of seconds in a year? Disregard leap years in your answer.

    ```cpp
    #define SECONDS_PER_YEAR (60UL*60UL*24UL*365UL)
    ```

    - **SECONDS_PER_YEAR** - good naming by using Caps and underscore
    - good syntax: not use ";", use of ()
    - display the calculation instead of the result for readability, as the pre-processor will evaluate constant expressions, making this penalty-free.
    - **UL** - to prevent overflow under 16-bit machine.

2. Write the ‘standard’ MIN **macro**. That is, a macro that takes two arguments and returns the smaller of the two arguments.

    ```cpp
    #define MIN (A,B) ((A)<= (B) ? (A) : (B))
    ```

    - Basic knowledge of the **#define** directive as used in macros. This is important, because until the inline operator becomes part of standard C, macros are the only portable way of generating inline code. Inline code is often necessary in embedded systems in order to achieve the required performance level.

    - Knowledge of the **ternary conditional operator ?**. This exists in C because it allows the compiler to potentially ***produce more optimal code*** than an if-then-else sequence. Given that performance is normally an issue in embedded systems, knowledge and use of this construct is important.

    - Understanding of the need to very carefully parenthesize arguments to macros.

    What happens if you use it for:
    ```cpp
        least = MIN(*p++, b);
    ```
    This will extend into:
    ```cpp
    ((*p++) <= (b) ? (*p++) : (b));
    //This means p is increased twice!
    ```

3. What is the purpose of the preprocessor directive **#error**?
The **#error** preprocessor directive causes the preprocessor to halt compilation and issue a custom error message. It's used for detecting and reporting compile-time errors based on defined conditions.


## Infinite Loops

4. Infinite loops often arise in embedded systems. How does one code an infinite loop in C?

    Most common:
    ```cpp
        while(1){
            ...
        }
    ```

    The K&R prefered, does not require extra evaluations:
    ```cpp
        for(;;){
            ...
        }
    ```

    Assembly/Basic/Fortran style:
    ```cpp
        Loop:
        ...
        goto Loop;
    ```

    
## Data Declarations

5. Definitions:

    | Data | Declaration |
    | - | - |
    | Integer | int a; |
    | Point to an integer |int* a; |
    | A pointer to a pointer to an integer |int** a; |
    | An array of ten integers | int a[10]| 
    | An array of ten pointers to integers |int* a[10]; |
    | A pointer to an array of ten integers | int (*a)[10];|
    | A pointer to a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns an integer |int (*a)(int); |
    | An array of ten pointers to functions that take an integer argument and return an integer. | int (*a[10])(int);   |


## Static

6. **Static** uses in C?

    In C there are 3 uses:

    1.  A variable declared **static** within the body of a function maintains its value between function invocations
        ```cpp 
        void counter(){
            static int count = 0;
            count++;
        }
        int main(){
            counter();  //1
            counter();  //2
            couter();   //3
        }
        ```
    2. A variable declared static within a module (file), but outside of a function, is accessible by all functions within that module. It is not accessible by a function within any other module. That is, it is a localized global.
    
        *module1.c*
        ```cpp
        static int globalVar = 10;
        void printVar(){
            printf("%d\n", globalVar);
        }
        void modifyVar(){
            globalVar +=5;
        }
        ```
        *main.c*
        ```cpp
        extern void printVar();
        extern void modifyVar();
        int main(){
            printVar(); //10
            modifyVar();
            printVar(); //15
        }
        ```
        *If other file tries to "extern int globalVar" it will fail.*

    3. Functions declared static within a module (file) may only be called by other functions within that module. That is, the scope of the function is localized to the module within which it is declared.

        *module.c*            
        ```cpp        
        static void hiddenFunction(){
            print ...
        }
        void callHiddenFunction(){
            hiddenFunction();
        }
        ```
        *main.c*
        ```cpp
        extern void callHiddenFunction();
        int main(){
            callHiddenFunction();   //Works
            //hiddenFunction();     //Does not work
        }
        ```
    
## Const

7. What does the keyword **const* mean?

    Makes a variable read-only, it promises it will not change, although it is possible to change it.

    What do the following declarations mean?

    |declaration | meaning |
    | - | - |
    |`const int a;` | read-only, const can be before or after the type, e.g., `int const a;`.|
    |`int const a;` | read-only, const can be before or after the type, e.g., `const int a;`.|
    |`const int* a;`| pointer to a const integer, pointer can change but its value should not. |
    |`int* const a;`| constant pointer, with modifiable content. |
    |`int const * a const;` | neither pointer or value should be modified. |

    **Const** helps the optimizer. It helps compiler to protect also the code (e.g. coder tries to change the const variable).

## Volatile
8. What does the keyword **volatile** mean? Give three examples.
    
    A volatile variable is one that can change unexpectedly. Consequently, the compiler can make no assumptions about the value of the variable. In particular, the optimizer must be careful to reload the variable every time it is used instead of holding a copy in a register. 
    Examples of volatile variables are:
    * Hardware registers in peripherals (e.g., status registers);
    * Non-stack variables referenced within an interrupt service routine;
    * Variables shared by multiple tasks in a multi-threaded application.

    Can a parameter be **const** and **volatile**?        
    Yes. E.g.: read-only status register. Also, const is only a promise, cannot enforce it to not change, and can be a variable in risk of change, therefore, also volatile.

    Can a pointer ve volatile? Yes, although not common. E.g. ISR modifies a pointer to a buffer.

    What is wrong with the following function?
    ```cpp
    int square(volatile int *ptr){
        return *ptr * *ptr;
    }
    ```
    The goal of this function is to calculate the square, but as volatile, the compiler will make it as:
    ```cpp
    {
        int a, b;
        a = *ptr;
        b = *ptr;
        return a*b;
    }
    ```
    Since it is possible the value of *ptr to change unexpectedly, it is possible that *a* and *b* are different, returning not the actual square. Therefore, the correct way would be:
    ```cpp
    {
        int a;
        a=*ptr;
        return a*a;
    }
    ```


## Bit Manipulation

9. Given an integer variable *a*, write two code fragments. The first should *set bit 3 of a*. The second should *clear bit 3 of a*. In both cases, the remaining bits should be unmodified.

    Several options:
    
    1. Using bit fields, **bad approach** - not portable accross compilers due to actual bit order and layout.
        
        ```cpp
        struct BitFields{
            uint8_t b0 : 1
            uint8_t b1 : 1
            uint8_t b2 : 1
            uint8_t b3 : 1
        }
        int main(){
            struct BitFields a;
            a.b3 = 1;
            a.b3 = 0;
        }    
        ```
    2. Using *#define* and bit masks, highly portable method:
        ```cpp
        #define BIT3 (0x1 << 3)
        static int a;
        void set_bit3(void) {
            a |= BIT3;
        }
        void clear_bit3(void) {
            a &= ~BIT3;
        }
        ```

    3. Another option "made on the spot" non portable:
        ```cpp
        int main()
        {
            int var = 0;
            var |= (1<<3);
            std::cout << var << std::endl;
            var &= ~(1<<3);
            std::cout << var << std::endl;
            return 0;
        }
        ```

## Accessing fixed memory locations

10. On a certain project it is required to set an integer variable at the absolute address 0x67a9 to the value 0xaa55. The compiler is a pure ANSI compiler. Write code to accomplish this task.

    One option:
    ```cpp
    int *ptr;
    ptr = (int *)0x67a9;    
    *ptr = 0xaa55;
    ```
    * `(int*)` indicates we are not setting a value, that could even be of a different type than *pointer address*, and also to indicate that this value is a *pointer (an address of memory)*! 

        In C++: uint* ptr = static_cast<uint*>(reinterpret_cast<void*>(0x67a9));
    Where `<uint*>` is the type we want,  `reinterpret_cast`tells intent to convert, as `<void *>`means any type.

    Another option more obfuscated: `*(int* const)(0x67a9)=0xaa55;`


## Interrupts

11. Typically, this new key word is __interrupt. The following code uses __interrupt to define an interrupt service routine. Comment on the code.
    ```cpp
    __interrupt double compute_area(double radius) {
    double area = PI * radius * radius;
    printf(“nArea = %f”, area);
    return area;
    }
    ```
    * ISR cannot return a value;
    * ISR cannot be passed parameters;
    * Printf oftens has problems with reentrancy and performance, so it should not be used;
    * On many processors / compilers, floating point operations are not necessarily re-entrant. In some cases one needs to stack additional registers, in other cases, one simply cannot do floating point in an ISR. Furthermore, given that a general rule of thumb is that ISRs should be short and sweet, one wonders about the wisdom of doing floating point math here.


## Code Examples

12. What does the following code output and why?
    ```cpp
    void foo(void){
    unsigned int a = 6;
    int b = -20;
    (a+b > 6) ? puts(“> 6”) : puts(“<= 6”);
    }
    ```
    The answer is that this outputs “> 6”. The reason for this is that expressions involving signed and unsigned types have all operands promoted to unsigned types. Thus –20 becomes a very large positive integer and the expression evaluates to greater than 6. 

13. Comment on the following code fragment?
    ```cpp
    unsigned int zero = 0;
    unsigned int compzero = 0xFFFF; /*1’s complement of zero */
    ```
    On machines where *int* is not 16 bits, it should be `unsigned int compzero = ~0;`. Word length is very important!


## Dynamic Memory Allocation

14. What are the problems with dynamic memory allocation in embedded systems?
    * Memory fragmentation;
    * Problems with garbage collection;
    * Variable execution time;
    * Limited resources;
    * Overhead;
    * Leaks;
    * ...

    What does the following code fragment output and why?
    ```cpp
    char *ptr;
    if ((ptr = (char *)malloc(0)) == NULL) {
        puts(“Got a null pointer”);
    }
    else {
        puts(“Got a valid pointer”);
    }
    ```
    Passing a value of *0* to *malloc*, `malloc(0)`, is implementation defined. It is not a C standard, so the behavior depends on the library used for its implementation.>


## Typedef
15. Is used to create aliases for existent data types, it does not create new ones,
    ```cpp
    typedef unsigned int uint;
    uint x = 10M
    printf("%u\b", x);  //10
    ```

    Which of the previous methods (if any) is preferred and why?
    ```cpp
    #define dPS struct s*;
    typedef struct s* tPS;
    ```
    Example:
    ```cpp
    dPS p1, p2; //==> struct s * p1, p2 => defines p1 to be a pointer to the structure and p2 to be an actual structure, which is probably not what you wanted
    tPS 03,p4;  //==>struct s* p3, struct s* p4;

    ```


## Obfuscated Syntax
16. C allows some appalling constructs. Is this construct legal, and if so what does this code do?
    ```cpp
    int a = 5, b = 7, c;
    c = a+++b;
    ```
    It is legal.

    From the *"maximum munch"* rule, the code is treated as:
    ```cpp
    int a = 5;
    int b = 7;
    int c;
    c = a++ + b
    ```
    In the end, `a=6, b=7, c=12`

    Example for `d=++a + b;` *d=13* as in this case *a* was pre-incremented.
